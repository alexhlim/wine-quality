# wine-quality

The purpose of this repository is to examine what makes a wine good quality. Here we have two different datasets, *winequality-red.csv* and *winequality-white.csv* (obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository), where I will performing two different approaches to understanding the target variable, quality. In *red-wine-quality.ipynb*, I treat the dataset as a classification problem, where I use models such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector machines. On the other hand, in *white-wine-quality.ipynb*, I utilize regression to understand the impact each feature has on white wine.

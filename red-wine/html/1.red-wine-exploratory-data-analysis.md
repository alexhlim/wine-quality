### Summary

In the above reference, two datasets were created, using red and white wine samples.
The inputs include objective tests (e.g. PH values) and the output is based on sensory data
(median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts). Each expert graded the wine quality 
between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).

### Features
   - **fixed acidity (nonvolatile acids)**: acids that do not evaporate when wine is heated.   
   - **volatile acidity**: acids that evaporate when wine heated, when in high amounts can give an unpleasant taste.
   - **citric acid**: type of fixed acid, added to wines to increase acidity or give a 'fresh' flavor. 
   - **residual sugar**: any natural grape sugars that are leftover after fermentation is done.
   - **chlorides**: contribute to the saltiness of the wine.
   - **free sulfur dioxide**: component of 'total sulfur dioxide', used to protect against microbes and oxidation.
   - **total sulfur dioxide**: free sulfur dioxide + bound sulfur dioxide  
   - **density**: used as a measure of the conversion of sugar to alcohol (ie. finished wine has less sugar but lots of alcohol and thus has a lower density)
   - **pH**: describes how acidic (0-6) or basic (8-14) the wine is. 
   - **sulphates**: a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide levels, which acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant
   - **alcohol**: percentage of alcohol present in the wine.

### Target variable
   - **quality**: score given to the wine between 0 (lowest) and 10 (highest).
   
### Goal 
As a consumer, I want make the right choice of purchasing good quality wine. First off, I want to learn about what characteristics make a good wine, thus increasing my knowledge when purchasing wine. Secondly, since I am the one purchasing the wine, I would like my machine to make the correct choice as much as possible, thus saving me money, while keeping me satisfied, in the long term.

**Observation**: Alcohol, sulphates, citric_acid, fixed_acidity, and residual sugars postively correlate with the quality of red wine. Let's now explore those features!


```python
# comparing alcohol content in different quality red wines
red_qual_unique = np.sort(red_wine.quality.unique())
nrows = 2
ncols = 3
figures, axes = plt.subplots(nrows = nrows,ncols = ncols, figsize=(12, 8))
axes = axes.flatten()
plt.subplots_adjust(hspace=0.3)
plt.suptitle('Red Wine Alcohol Distributions for Different Qualities', fontsize=16)

for qual, axis in zip(red_qual_unique, axes):
    sns.distplot(red_wine.alcohol[red_wine.quality == qual], kde = False, color=dark_red, ax=axis).set_title('Quality = {}'.format(str(qual)))

```


![png](output_15_0.png)



```python
''' Plots a boxplot and swarmplot of two variables. '''
def plot_boxplot(x_name, y_name, dset, figsize, ymin, ymax, swarmplot=False):
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=figsize)
    fig = sns.boxplot(x = dset[x_name], y = dset[y_name], palette = 'OrRd' )
    if swarmplot is True:
        sns.swarmplot(x = dset[x_name], y = dset[y_name], palette = 'OrRd' )
    plt.suptitle('{} Boxplot Against {}'.format(y_name, x_name), fontsize=16)
    fig.axis(ymin=ymin, ymax=ymax)
```


```python
plot_boxplot(x_name='quality', y_name='alcohol', dset=red_wine, figsize=(8,6), ymin=8, ymax=15)
```


![png](output_17_0.png)


**Observation**: I notice that in higher quality wines, there tends to be a higher alcohol content. I see that there are quite a few outliers in 5 and fewer outliers in 6. It seems to me that the range of alcohol is more varaible in the 'bad' wines. Also, the medians in 7-8 are sizeably greater than the medians of 6 and below, which confirms that there is definitely a positive relationship between alcohol and quality.


```python
plot_boxplot(x_name='quality', y_name='sulphates', dset=red_wine, figsize=(8,6), ymin=0.25, ymax=2.05, swarmplot=True)
```


![png](output_19_0.png)


**Observation**: The medians of 7-8 are greater than 5 and below, but not by a lot. However, by looking at the whiskers of the boxplots, the range of sulphates seem to be similar for 'good' and 'bad' quality wines. This is definitely not as strong of an indicator as alcohol, but there is still a positive relationship between sulphates content and quality wines.


```python
plot_boxplot(x_name='quality', y_name='citric_acid', dset=red_wine, figsize=(8,6), ymin=-0.25, ymax=1.2, swarmplot=True)
```


![png](output_21_0.png)


**Observation**: There definitely is a positive correlation here with citric acids, but I also see that the range of citric acids seems to be roughly similary for all qualities of wines (0% - 0.8%). Also, we need to consider that there are far fewer samples in 7-8, meaning that as we gather more information, these distributions might start to look more similar. Furthermore, it is also worth noting that despite class imbalance, there is a higher max frequency in 7 than 5 or 6 but also a lower quartile range in 7. Citric acids give wines 'fresh' flavor, and it seems that the wine tasters tend to enjoy wine with higher citric acid content, but it does not mean they cannot enjoy it if it is lower. There is probably some sort of balance with another feature of wine that could case these wine tasters to highly rank low citric acid wine.


```python
plot_boxplot(x_name='quality', y_name='fixed_acidity', dset=red_wine, figsize=(8,6), ymin=3, ymax=16.5, swarmplot=True)
```


![png](output_23_0.png)


**Observation**: As we increase in fixed_acidity, the quality of wine tends to be higher. We see the quartile ranges increase from 4-7. It is interesting to look at 8, because despite having not many samples, we see a noticeable spread in the distribution. Again, this might be that more fixed_acidity content does not necessarily equate to a good wine.
